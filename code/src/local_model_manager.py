local_model_manager.py

This file is responsible for training our local models.
- It will take the preprocessed Spark DataFrame and split it into partitions.
- For each partition, it trains a local model (like a proximity tree).
- Then, it collects all these local models into one ensemble.
- This ensemble will be used later for making predictions.
